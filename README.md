# Walt — Architecture & Design

**Walt** is a modular orchestration platform designed to empower users to build, compose, and scale automated workflows (or “agents”) in a safe, maintainable, and extensible way.

- Users sign up on **walt.ai** (or your chosen domain) to create an account, configure their workspace, and deploy agents.
- Walt’s intent is to provide a robust backbone for structuring agent logic, connecting to external services, managing state, scheduling, observability, and security.
- Walt accomplishes this by combining a plugin-based core engine, fine-grained permissioning, interface abstractions, and a scalable deployment model.

## What You’ll Find in This Repo

This repository is the public home for Walt’s architecture documents and design thinking. While we’re early in the rollout, below is the intended structure. As we flesh out the content, each link will lead to its own document.

- [Overview](docs/overview.md) — high-level product vision, goals, and user scenarios
- [System Architecture](docs/system_architecture.md) — modules, data flow, components, boundaries
- [Interfaces & APIs](docs/apis_and_interfaces.md) — how external systems talk to Walt, plugin APIs
- [Deployment & Infrastructure](docs/deployment.md) — how Walt runs, scaling, reliability
- [Security & Trust](docs/security.md) — permission models, sandboxing, threat assumptions
- [Examples & Use Cases](docs/examples/README.md) — how users will build workflows & agents
- [Roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) — planned features and evolution
- [Glossary](docs/glossary.md) — definitions of domain terms

## Core Principles & Design Tenets

- **Composability:** users should build small, reusable building blocks that can be wired together.
- **Safety & Isolation:** user-defined logic or plugin components must run under strong constraints to avoid escalation or misuse.
- **Extensibility:** third parties should be able to extend Walt through well-defined APIs / plugin interfaces.
- **Observability & Debuggability:** everything in Walt should be traceable, inspectable, and auditable.
- **Scalability & Resilience:** Walt must handle many agents and workflows in parallel, recover from failures, and scale elastically.
